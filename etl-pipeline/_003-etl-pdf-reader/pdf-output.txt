             What   is Oracle  VirtualBox?    Where   do  I  get  it?  and  how  much does  it  cost?                                                                                                                 

             I  can’t  get  the  virtual  machines  to  work  properly  in  Oracle  VirtualBox. What  can   I  do?                                                                                                    

             What   is Security  Workstation    virtual machine?                                                                                                                                                      

             After  importing   and  starting  the VM,  there  is no  login prompt,   only  a black  screen.   What  can  I do  now?                                                                                  

             Why   do  I  need all  that  RAM memory?                                                                                                                                                                 

             Why   are my   mouse   and   keyboard   not  working   outside   of the VM?                                                                                                                              

             The  labs  are too  long, and   we  can't finish it in one  class  period.  What  should   I do?                                                                                                         

             How   do  I  remove  the virtual machines     when   I  am  done with  the course?                                                                                                                       

             How   do  I  replace a file  that  was  accidentally deleted?                                                                                                                                            

             I  made  a change   in a VM,  and  it is  not  working properly   anymore.                                                                                                                               

             The  VM   screen  is black,  what  do  I  do  now?                                                                                                                                                       

             I  copied the  command     from  the  PDF  and   pasted  it into the terminal.  Why   is it  not  working?                                                                                               

             The  command      is  really  long.  What  can  I do  to make  it  easier?                                                                                                                               

             I  have mistyped   a  long command.      Do  I  have  to  retype  again  to  fix  it?                                                                                                                    

             I  got  this  message when    I  tried  to SSH  into  a router:  WARNING:   REMOTE     HOST    IDENTIFICATION      HAS

3. **Keyboard and Mouse Issues Outside VM**: Users are advised that if their keyboard or mouse does not work outside of the virtual machine, they can use the VirtualBox host key (the CTRL key on the right side) to control functions inside the VM from outside.

4. **Saving State for Future Use**: The section outlines how users can save the state of a running VM so they can pick up where they left off at a later time, and resume their lab work without having to start from scratch every session.

5. **Removing Virtual Machines**: Instructions are provided on how to properly remove virtual machines, which includes shutting down the VM first before removing it by deleting all its files.

6. **Recovering Deleted Files**: Users also learn that if they accidentally delete a file within a VM, they can use similar steps as for saving the state (shutting down and then removing/redeleting) to recover their data without losing work in progress.

Network    Security  v1.0                                                                                                                                                                                

             After  importing   and  starting  the VM,  there  is no  login prompt,   only  a black  screen.   What  can  I do  now?                                                                                  

                  Shut down   the VM.  Right-click  the imported  VM   and select  Settings  > click Display.  You  can  increase  the                                                                                
                  amount   of  Video  Memory  and/or  change   the Graphic  Controller  and  restart the VM.                                                                                                          

                  Back  to Top                                                                                                                                                                                        

             Why   do  I  need all  that  RAM memory?                                                                                                                                                                 

                  In  this  course,  there  is only  one virtual  machine.  The minimum  RAM memory    requirement   to run Security                                                                                  
                  Workstation  virtual machine   is  1 GB.  Increasing the amount   of RAM   from  the minimum    requirement   can                                                                                   
                  enhance   the performance    of  the  VM.

             Why   are my   mouse   and   keyboard   not  working   outside   of the VM?                                                                                                                              

                  If  your  keyboard  or  mouse  does  not  function  outside  of the  VM,  press  the CTRL  key  that  is  on  the  right  side  of                                                                  
                  the keyboard.  This  is  called  the  VirtualBox  host  key.  The host  key is  shown  on the lower  right-hand  corner  of                                                                         
                  the VM  window.   Other  host operating  systems   may   use another  key  as the  host key.

                  continue  the labs at a later time. To save  the VM   state, click  the  Save  the  machine state  radio button  and                                                                                
                  click  OK  when closing  the VM.  The  next time  you start the virtual machine,  you  will  be  able  to resume  working                                                                           
                  in  the  operating  system  from  the  saved  state.

Cisco  Public  Page  2  of 3           www.netacad.comprev_section_summary: The section covers several important aspects for managing VMs in a network security lab, particularly focusing on troubleshooting common issues and ensuring optimal performance:

1. **Problem Resolution for No Login Prompt**: If a black screen appears after importing and starting a virtual machine (VM), users can address this by increasing the amount of video memory or changing the graphic controller settings within the VM's settings.

2. **RAM Memory Requirements**: There is an explanation about the minimum requirement of 1 GB RAM needed to run the Security Workstation VM in the course, and how increasing this memory improves VM performance.

3. **Keyboard and Mouse Issues Outside VM**: Users are advised that if their keyboard or mouse does not work outside of the virtual machine, they can use the VirtualBox host key (the CTRL key on the right side) to control functions inside the VM from outside.

4. **Saving State for Future Use**: The section outlines how users can save the state of a running VM so they can pick up where they left off at a later time, and resume their lab work without having to start from scratch every session.

5. **Removing Virtual Machines**: Instructions are provided on how to properly remove virtual machines, which includes shutting down the VM first before removing it by deleting all its files.

                  the login screen.                                                                                                                                                                                   

                  Back  to Top                                                                                                                                                                                        

             I  copied the  command     from  the  PDF  and   pasted  it into the terminal.  Why   is it  not  working?                                                                                               

                  When   copying  and  pasting  commands     from lab documents,    there is a possibility  that  the  formatting  and                                                                                
                  characters  from  the document   may   not be compatible   with the  command    line.  The solution is  to  delete  and                                                                             
                  retype the offending  characters.  The  command     should  then  run.                                                                                                                              

                  Back  to Top                                                                                                                                                                                        

             The  command      is  really  long.  What  can  I do  to make  it  easier?                                                                                                                               

                  Linux is designed  for the command     line interface.  Several features are  included  to  facilitate  entering                                                                                    
                  commands.    One   of  those  features  is TAB  key  autocompletion. When   typing a command     or a directory path,                                                                               
                  use the TAB   key  to  complete it.  Linux  will  display  the possible  completions  if  the  typed portion  is  not unique.                                                                       
                  Linux will  autocomplete  the command     or path as  soon  as the typed  portion is unique.                                                                                                        

                  Back  to Top                                                                                                                                                                                        

             I  have mistyped   a  long command.      Do  I  have  to  retype  again  to  fix  it?                                                                                                                    

                  You  can use  the up  arrow  to  access the commands     that were  executed   earlier  in  the  same  terminal  window.                                                                            
                  The command     can  then be  edited.

             I  got  this  message when    I  tried  to SSH  into  a router:  WARNING:   REMOTE     HOST    IDENTIFICATION       HAS
