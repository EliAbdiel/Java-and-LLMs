* Key concepts:
	+ ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) framework
	+ Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Entities:
	+ Raw data sources
	+ Structured vector store
	+ AI model

The Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) framework serves as the backbone of data processing within the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) use case.
The ETL pipeline orchestrates the flow from raw data sources to a structured vector store, ensuring data is in the optimal format for retrieval by the AI model.
The RAG use case is text to augment the capabilities of generative models by retrieving relevant information from a body of data to enhance the quality and relevance of the generated output.
